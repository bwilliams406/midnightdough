Snickerdoodle

3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
• 2 teaspoons cream of tartar*
• 1 teaspoon baking soda
• 1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
• 1/2 teaspoon salt
• 1 cup (16 Tbsp; 226g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
• 1 and 1/3 cup (267g) granulated
sugar
• 1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature
• 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Topping
1/3 cup (70g) granulated sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Oven at 375 for 10 minutes at 40 grams. Bigger size 70-80 grams

In a large bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.
With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 3 different parts. The dough will be thick.

Whisk the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl.

Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chip

Yield: ~10 large cookies
Prep Time: 15 min
Chill Time: 30 min (optional but better)
Bake Time: 12-14 min

⸻

Ingredients
    •    1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cold, cubed
    •    1 1/4 cups dark brown sugar, packed
    •    1/2 cup granulated sugar
    •    2 large eggs
    •    2 tsp vanilla extract
    •    2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (scoop and level)
    •    1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder (e.g., Valrhona, Droste)
    •    1 tsp baking soda
    •    3/4 tsp kosher salt
    •    1 1/2 cups dark chocolate chunks (70–85%)
    •    Optional: 1/2 tsp espresso powder (boosts the chocolate depth)
    •    Flaky sea salt for topping (highly recommended)

⸻

Instructions
    1.    Cream butter + sugars:
Beat cubed cold butter, brown sugar, and white sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy (3–4 min).
    2.    Add eggs + vanilla:
Beat in eggs one at a time. Add vanilla. Mix until combined.
    3.    Dry ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt (and espresso powder if using). Gradually add to wet mixture until just combined.
    4.    Fold in chocolate chunks:
Use a spatula to stir in most of the chocolate chunks. Save a handful to press into the tops.
    5.    Chill (optional but ideal):
Scoop 10 large dough balls (~4 oz each), place on a lined tray, and chill for 30+ minutes (or overnight for deeper flavor).
    6.    Bake:
Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake 5–6 dough balls per tray for 12–14 min, until edges are set and centers puffed but soft.
    7.    Finish:
Immediately press extra chocolate chunks on top. Sprinkle flaky sea salt. Let cool 10 min on tray before serving warm.

Tips for Perfect Results
    •    Cold butter helps keep them thick.
    •    Weigh dough balls if possible (~110–120g each).
    •    Dutch-process cocoa gives them deep richness—don’t sub natural cocoa.
    •    Don’t overbake. They’ll look slightly underdone in the center when perfect.

For lemon sugar cookies made from this dough, the best weight per cookie depends on the texture you want:
Recommended Cookie Weights
Soft & Chewy (most common):
28–32 grams each (about 1 heaping tablespoon or a medium cookie scoop)➡️ Yields ~40–48 cookies from the double batch.
Thick Bakery-Style Cookies:
45–55 grams each (about 3 tbsp or a large scoop)➡️ Yields ~24–30 cookies.
Smaller Bite-Size Cookies:
18–22 grams each➡️ Yields ~55–60 cookies.

Best Choice for This Recipe
30 grams is the sweet spot — spreads nicely, stays soft in the center, and gives even baking.
